# Game-Connect-Four

Welcome to the Connect Four game development repository!  
Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored tokens into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four tokens.  

The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. It is therefore a type of m,n,k-game (m,n,4) with restricted piece placement. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

This project provides a Python implementation of Connect Four with a graphical interface built using **Pygame**.
